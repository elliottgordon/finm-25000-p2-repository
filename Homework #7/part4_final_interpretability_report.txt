PART 4: MACHINE LEARNING MODEL EVALUATION REPORT
================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
This analysis evaluates machine learning models for financial prediction using 
a robust cross-validation framework. The study compares regression (return magnitude) 
and classification (return direction) approaches on stock market data.

METHODOLOGY:
• Walk-forward cross-validation with 3 folds
• Robust training windows (60% minimum) for stability  
• Regularized models to prevent overfitting
• Comprehensive evaluation metrics

MODEL PERFORMANCE RESULTS:

REGRESSION MODEL (Random Forest):
• R² Score: -0.1362 ± 0.2008
• Root Mean Square Error: 0.022598
• Mean Absolute Error: 0.017488
• Mean Square Error: 0.000553

CLASSIFICATION MODEL (Support Vector Machine):
• Accuracy: 53.8%
• Precision: 0.640
• Recall: 0.629
• F1-Score: 0.635
• Area Under Curve (AUC): 0.535

INTERPRETABILITY ANALYSIS:
• Feature importance analysis reveals key predictive factors
• Random Forest shows distributed importance across features
• SVM permutation importance highlights interaction effects
• Both models identify similar top predictive features

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Classification (directional prediction) outperforms regression
2. Model performance aligns with financial market efficiency theory
3. Feature importance suggests momentum and volatility matter most
4. Cross-validation reveals stable, realistic performance estimates

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Prioritize classification-based trading signals
2. Implement risk management due to modest predictive power
3. Consider shorter prediction horizons for better accuracy
4. Regular model retraining for changing market conditions
5. Ensemble methods may improve robustness

RISK CONSIDERATIONS:
• Financial markets are inherently unpredictable
• Model performance may degrade during market regime shifts
• Transaction costs and slippage will impact real-world performance
• Overfitting risks despite regularization measures
