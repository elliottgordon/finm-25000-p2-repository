# Machine Learning for Trading Strategies

## 📌 Objective

- Clean and engineer features from real market data
- Design and validate ML models for forecasting or signal classification
- Evaluate performance using robust time-series methodology
- Reflect on interpretability, ethics, and modeling pitfalls unique to finance

---

## 📦 Part 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing

### 🧠 Tasks

#### Download Historical Market Data
- Use yfinance to retrieve 5 years of EOD data (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, SPY)
- Include OHLCV and optionally other indicators (e.g., VIX)

#### Clean the Data
- Handle missing or non-trading days
- Apply forward-fill or drop logic

#### Smooth and Normalize
- Remove outliers using rolling z-scores
- Apply standard scaling or min-max normalization for each feature column

### 📦 Deliverables
- Cleaned DataFrame with aligned date index
- Notebook section describing cleaning logic and rationale

## ⚙️ Part 2: Feature Engineering & Selection

### 🧠 Tasks

#### Create Technical Indicators
- SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD
- Rolling volatility, return lags (1, 5, 10-day)

#### Add Derived Features
- Momentum: difference of price across lags
- Binary labels: price up/down over next 5 days
- Optional: sector ETF signals or macro indicators

#### Explore Feature Selection
- Plot correlation heatmap
- Apply PCA
- Drop collinear or low-value predictors

### 📦 Deliverables
- Feature matrix X and label vector y
- Justified selection of top 10–20 features
- Summary chart or table of engineered features

## 🤖 Part 3: Model Building & Training

### 🧠 Tasks

#### Train ML Models
- Regression: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor
- Classification: LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier

#### Walk-Forward Validation
- Use rolling training/testing windows (e.g., expanding window or 80/20 split every 200 days)
- Track out-of-sample predictions over time

#### Avoid Look-Ahead Bias
- Ensure all features use only past data
- Lag all predictors when computing forward labels

### 📦 Deliverables
- Model objects and prediction outputs
- Time-series of walk-forward performance
- Commentary on any signs of overfitting

---

## 📊 Part 4: Model Evaluation & Interpretation

### 🧠 Tasks

#### Metrics
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
- Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²
- Include confusion matrix and ROC curve if applicable

#### Interpret Results
- Use feature_importances_, coefficients, or SHAP
- Comment on which features are driving signals

#### Portfolio Simulation (Optional)
- Apply binary predictions to build long/flat strategy
- Track hypothetical equity curve with no leverage
- Compare with SPY benchmark

### 📦 Deliverables
- Evaluation table of metrics
- Plots: ROC curve, confusion matrix, prediction curve
- Interpretability summary (100–200 words)

---

## 🧠 Part 5: Unsupervised Exploration

### 🧠 Tasks

#### Apply Clustering
- Use k-means or hierarchical clustering on feature matrix
- Group stocks by behavioral similarity

#### Visualize Regimes
- Cluster transitions through time
- Identify periods of volatility shift or correlation clusters

### 📦 Deliverables
- Cluster plots (e.g., silhouette, dendrogram)
- Short markdown reflection on insights discovered

---

## 📰 Part 6: Natural Language Processing for Market Sentiment

### 🎯 Objective
Use NLP techniques to extract sentiment from financial news headlines or articles and explore how this information can be incorporated into a trading model.

### 🧩 Tasks

#### Collect Financial News
- Use a news aggregator API (e.g., NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance RSS)
- Retrieve headlines or brief snippets related to selected tickers (e.g., AAPL, SPY)
- Store data as a DataFrame with columns: timestamp, ticker, headline, source

#### Clean and Preprocess Text
- Convert to lowercase, remove punctuation, stop words
- Tokenize text and optionally apply stemming or lemmatization

#### Apply Sentiment Analysis Models
- Use pretrained models (e.g., VADER from nltk, TextBlob, or transformers)
- Compute polarity score or binary sentiment classification
- Aggregate sentiment scores daily per ticker:

```python
daily_sentiment = news.groupby(['date', 'ticker'])['sentiment_score'].mean()
```

#### Integrate Sentiment as a Feature
- Merge sentiment scores with market data
- Use as input to the ML model for forecasting or classification
- Test whether sentiment improves predictive performance

#### Visualize Sentiment Trends
- Plot average sentiment vs. stock price over time
- Compare high-sentiment and low-sentiment days

### 📦 Deliverables
- News DataFrame with sentiment scores
- Visualization of sentiment trends
- Updated feature matrix including sentiment
- Evaluation comparison with and without sentiment features
- Brief commentary on the correlation between news tone and price movement
